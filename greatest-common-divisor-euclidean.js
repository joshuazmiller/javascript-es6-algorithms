/**
 * This is Euclid's algorithm for finding greatest common divisor, also known as greatest common factor.
 * Euclid's formula works for any two positive integers.
 * The variable r stands for remainder.
 * Wikipedia on worst-case: "The Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is 
 * the number of digits in the smaller number b." In other words, very, very fast.
