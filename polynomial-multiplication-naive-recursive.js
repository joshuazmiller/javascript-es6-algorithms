/**
 * INPUTS:
 * Inputs A and B are polynomials expressed as arrays filled only with their constants. Before explaining the 
 * polynomial representation further, here's an example. [2,2] represents the polynomial 2x + 2 while [3,5,4] 
 * represents 3x^2 + 5x + 4. Bascially, the rightmost element of each array is assumed to have x^0 added to 
 * its constant, while the leftmost element is assumed to have x^(n - 1) where n is the length of the array. 
 * This is the shorthand for representing polynomials in our function. Additionally, if one of the arrays is 
 * shorter than the other then the array that is shorter should be padded on the left with 0s. For example, 
 * if you have (2x + 2)(3x^2 + 5x + 4) they should be provided as inputs to our function in the format [0,2,2] 
 * and [3,5,4].
 * 
 * MATH:
 * This is a representation of the classical mathematical approach to solving polynomials by hand. To implement 
 * the classical method requires a divide-and-conquer technique which is actually quite complicated to reason
 * about. It's based off similarly complex pseudo code given on a recorded lecture by Neil Rhodes at UCSD. 
 * 
 * EFFICIENCY:
 * This function runs with an efficiency of O(n^2) or more precisely k*4n^2 since there are 4 branches which 
 * each take n^2 time. This note is important because it's a precursor to the Karatsuba algorithm which cuts
 * the formula to only 3 branches which is a noticable improvement because 3^(log2 n) equals n^1.58 so with
 * Karatsuba we have O(n^1.58). That's why this method is called "naive" since the Karatsuba is better.
