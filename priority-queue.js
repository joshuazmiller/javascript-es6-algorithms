/**
 * A priority queue is a type of queue where each element is assigned a priority and elements are retrieved highest
 * priority first. Priority queues require that an element with the highest priority be able to be retrieved in linear
 * time, that an element can be added and removed efficiently, and that an element's priority can be readily modified.
 * The challenge with a priority queue is that the rudimentary data structures such as an array, linked-list, standard
 * queue, or stack perform sub-optimally and therefore do not meet this criteria. Arrays have an inefficient time
 * retrieving a maximum value or alternatively keeping the array sorted. Linked-lists have difficulty inserting elements
 * according to their priorities at the appropriate positions without scanning the entire structure. Standard queues and
 * stacks rely on arrays or linked-lists as underlying types so are no better.
 *
 * The solution is using a data structure called a binary heap. A binary heap is a type of binary tree with the added
 * restriction that each level be full from left-to-right before creating another level. This leads to O(log n) in
 * regards to the growth of the tree's height. A priority queue has a max-heap property requirement in which each parent
 * node is greater-or-equal to each one of its children. The underlying data structure that a binary heap rests on is an
 * array with the added property of being entirely predictable as to the indexes of each elements' parent and children.
 * A parent can always be located at the floor(index/2). The children can be found at 2*index and 2*index + 1. These
 * properties make it easy and efficient to bubble up and bubble down elements that are in incorrect positions by
 * comparing the element with the value of its children or parent. As such, in a priority queue, the max element can be
 * pulled off the top and replaced by the last element of the structure which can then be sifted downwards into its
 * correct spot. The downwards sift only takes O(log n) time. Similarly, a new element can be appended to the tree and
 * then sifted up into its appropriate spot in O(log n) time. The priority of an element can also be modified and then
 * sifted into its correct spot as well in O(log n) time. Furthermore, since the relationship between where a parent and
 * its children is entirely predictable, parent-child priority data is not stored, making this structure space efficient
 * as well.
 *
 * The following is an implementation of a priority queue:
