/**
 * The Bentley-McIlroy 3-way partitioning schema is an exceptionally efficient quicksort algorithm which speeds up the
 * swapping of duplicate values exponentially. Sorting a series which contains many duplicate values with an Hoare or Lomuto
 * quicksort quickly crawls to quadratic O(n^2) time because when an element is compared to its duplicate the partitioning
 * operation is just as ineffective as when picking the smallest or largest value in the array as a partition. The Bentley
 * schema instead of uselessly swapping a duplicate value to the opposite side of the array, ensures that a duplicate value
 * ends up next to its pivot. This creates a drastic improvement because not only is the swap useful and effective but it
 * also expands the left and right bounds of the already sorted elements, making duplicates actually speed up the sort and
 * have a positive impact!
 *
 * METHOD:
 * When a pivot is compared to a duplicate value, after performing the usual left<=>right swap, it is swapped again to the
 * left-most or right-most part of the array (depending on the side it's on) which are partitions 1 and 3. After all the
 * values on either side of the pivot have been properly swapped to the appropriate side, the elements in partitions 1
 * and 3 are merged into the middle right next to the pivot. The left and right bounds remaining to be sorted are then 
 * expanded to exclude the merged items.
 *
 * EFFICIENCY:
 * Performs O(n log n) even when there are duplicates in the array. A pivot with a duplicate is considered an optimal choice
 * vs. Hoare or Lomuto schemes where such pivots tilt towards quadratic time.
