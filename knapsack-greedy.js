/**
 * Greedy Algorithms: In a greedy algorithm we find a 'safe move' which is a move that is the logical
 * best next move, and once taken, the move reduces the problem into a subproblem (and then we take the 
 * next safe-move etc.). In the knapsack problem the safe-move is to put the maximum available weight 
 * from the next most valuable item into the knapsack (to the extent that the knapsack can hold more 
 * weight of course). After reducing the weight of that item to 0 we have a subproblem and can take the
 * maximum weight of the next most valuable item that will fit into the knapsack, and we do this greedy 
 * move again and again.
 * 
 * In our function the items are pre-sorted with the highest value/weight ratios first in descending 
 * order (the most valuable items in descending order). Without pre-sorting, this function would run 
 * O(n^2) because we'd need to do an inner loop finding the next most valuable item. With pre-sorting 
 * with Quicksort or Mergesort you can get O(n log n) because our function would just be O(n) as in 
 * this example.
